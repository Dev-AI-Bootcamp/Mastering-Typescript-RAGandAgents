# The Dev-AI-Bootcamp's 3 big AI projects rewritten in Typescript.

You'll find in the this project three different files that all run independantly of each other and include the three core projects we learned in the AI Dev Bootcamp
- agentPersonas.ts - Building Agents that pass information one to the other
- agentTools.ts - Tool calling agent where a LLM call can use a local function when needed
- rag.ts - full RAG implementation loading all information from a website.

## Language
- of course this is built with typescript, but like the saying goes: You can convert typescript into javascript by using the delete key.

## How to install
- Fork and then clone the repo
- run ```npm i --force``` to install dependencies including a conflict that will be fixed by "--force"
- review the code
- start it with ```npm run start```
